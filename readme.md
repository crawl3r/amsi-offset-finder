Super basic. Finds the listed functions in AMSI (hardcoded, but they all existed when I made the script). Dumps their current address in the process and their offset from the amsi base.

I tend to use these offsets when writing my AMSI bypasses, so this comes in handy if I hardcode addresses (bad), or just need a quick tester. Enjoy.
